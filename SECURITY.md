# Security Summary

This document outlines security considerations for the Rivals of Catan application.

## Known Security Issues

### 1. Unsafe Java Deserialization (Pre-existing)

**Location**: `src/main/java/view/NetworkPlayerView.java:49`  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Documented, Not Fixed (Requires protocol redesign)

#### Description
The network communication uses Java's `ObjectInputStream` for deserializing messages from remote clients. Java deserialization is known to have security vulnerabilities where malicious payloads can execute arbitrary code during the deserialization process.

#### Current Mitigation
- Post-deserialization validation: Only String objects are accepted
- Error logging for rejected non-String objects
- Security warnings in code documentation

#### Why Not Fixed
Fixing this vulnerability properly requires:
1. Replacing Java serialization with a safe format (JSON, Protocol Buffers)
2. Changing the entire network protocol
3. Updating both client and server implementations
4. Testing network compatibility

This is beyond the scope of minimal MVC/SOLID refactoring changes.

#### Recommendations for Production Use

**Short-term mitigations:**
1. Use network isolation (firewall rules)
2. Implement authentication before allowing connections
3. Use TLS/SSL for encrypted connections
4. Validate source IP addresses

**Long-term solution:**
Replace Java serialization with JSON-based communication:
```java
// Current (unsafe):
ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream

// Recommended:
- Use Gson or Jackson for JSON serialization
- Use simple text-based protocol
- Or use Protocol Buffers with schema validation
```

#### Code Locations
- `src/main/java/view/NetworkPlayerView.java` - View layer implementation
- `src/main/java/Main.java` - Client-side connection

#### Detection
CodeQL Analysis: `java/unsafe-deserialization`

## Security Best Practices Applied

### 1. Input Validation
- Resource names validated before use
- Card placement validated before applying
- Cost parsing validates integer inputs

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- Network I/O isolated in view layer
- Security validation centralized in NetworkPlayerView
- Clear boundaries between layers

### 3. Defensive Programming
- Null checks throughout codebase
- Exception handling in network operations
- Validation of user inputs

## Secure Development Guidelines

When extending this codebase:

1. **Never trust user input** - Always validate and sanitize
2. **Use safe serialization** - Prefer JSON over Java serialization for new features
3. **Implement authentication** - Add user authentication for multiplayer
4. **Use encryption** - Implement TLS/SSL for network connections
5. **Follow least privilege** - Limit access to system resources

## Security Testing

### Current Testing
- ✅ CodeQL static analysis run
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ Known vulnerabilities documented

### Recommended Additional Testing
- [ ] Penetration testing of network protocol
- [ ] Fuzz testing of input parsers
- [ ] Security code review by security expert
- [ ] Static analysis with additional tools (SpotBugs, FindSecBugs)
