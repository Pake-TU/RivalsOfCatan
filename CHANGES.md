# Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the issues mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## 1. Resource Input Validation Fix ✅

### Problem
When players entered invalid resource names (e.g., "G" instead of "Grain"), the game would silently ignore the input. This could be exploited to avoid giving resources while still taking them.

### Solution
- **Added `validateAndPromptResource()` method** in `Player.java`: Loops until player provides a valid resource name
- **Added `promptAndRemoveResource()` method** in `Player.java`: Validates and retries when discarding resources
- **Updated all resource prompts** to use validation:
  - `Player.gainResource()` - validates on invalid input
  - `Card.applyEffect()` - Merchant Caravan and Goldsmith now validate
  - `Server` event handlers - Trade, Celebration, Plentiful Harvest, Trade Ships Race, Traveling Merchant, Invention

### Impact
Players can no longer bypass resource costs or lose resources due to typos. The game will keep asking until a valid resource is entered.

## 2. Maven Build System ✅

### Problem
The project had no build system, using a manually downloaded `gson.jar` and manual compilation commands.

### Solution
- **Created `pom.xml`** with:
  - Maven project structure
  - Dependencies: Gson 2.10.1, JUnit 5.10.1
  - Compiler plugin (Java 11)
  - Shade plugin for fat JAR creation
- **Restructured folders** to Maven conventions:
  - `src/main/java/` - All Java source files
  - `src/main/resources/` - cards.json and other resources
  - `src/test/java/` - Test files (to be added)
- **Updated `Card.java`** to load cards.json from classpath (works with JAR)
- **Updated `.gitignore`** for Maven artifacts

### Impact
- Easy dependency management
- One command to build: `mvn package`
- Generates runnable JAR: `target/rivals-of-catan-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-with-dependencies.jar`
- Standard project structure for Java projects

## 3. Interfaces for Better Architecture ✅

### Problem
The code lacked clear interfaces, making it harder to extend, test, and maintain for future expansions.

### Solution
Created three key interfaces:

1. **`IPlayer` interface** (`model/interfaces/IPlayer.java`)
   - Defines all player operations (send/receive, resources, cards, points)
   - Implemented by `Player` class
   - Enables easy addition of new player types (AI, remote, mock for testing)

2. **`IGameManager` interface** (`controller/interfaces/IGameManager.java`)
   - Base for all game phase managers
   - Provides `getPhaseName()` and `initialize()` methods
   - Implemented by: ProductionManager, ReplenishManager, ExchangeManager, InitializationManager

3. **`ICardEffect` interface** (`model/interfaces/ICardEffect.java`)
   - Defines card behavior contract
   - Enables extensible card effects for future eras
   - Provides `applyEffect()`, `canPlay()`, and `getEffectDescription()`

### Impact
- **Modifiability**: Changes to one manager don't affect others
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new game phases, player types, or card effects
- **Testability**: Interfaces allow mocking and unit testing
- Prepared for future expansions and different eras

## 4. Updated Documentation ✅

### Changes to README.md
- Removed old planned structure
- Added Maven build and run instructions
- Documented actual project structure
- Explained architecture (MVC, SOLID principles)
- Listed key interfaces and design patterns
- Added feature highlights

## Security Summary

### Known Security Issue (Pre-existing)
**Location**: `src/main/java/network/OnlinePlayer.java:86`  
**Issue**: Unsafe deserialization using Java ObjectInputStream  
**Status**: Not fixed (documented, has basic validation)

**Details**:
- This security vulnerability existed before our changes
- It's properly documented with security warnings in the code
- Has basic mitigation: validates objects are Strings only
- Recommendations for production are documented (use JSON, add TLS, etc.)

**Recommendation**: For production use, replace Java serialization with JSON-based communication.

## Testing

All changes were tested:
- ✅ Code compiles with Maven: `mvn clean compile`
- ✅ Package builds successfully: `mvn package`
- ✅ Game runs with bot mode: `java -jar target/rivals-of-catan-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-with-dependencies.jar bot`
- ✅ Resource validation works (manual testing)

## Files Changed

### Modified Files
- `src/main/java/model/Player.java` - Added validation methods, implemented IPlayer
- `src/main/java/model/Card.java` - Updated resource prompts, classpath loading
- `src/main/java/Server.java` - Updated event resource prompts
- `src/main/java/controller/*.java` - All managers now implement IGameManager
- `.gitignore` - Added Maven artifacts
- `README.md` - Complete rewrite with new structure

### New Files
- `pom.xml` - Maven configuration
- `src/main/java/model/interfaces/IPlayer.java`
- `src/main/java/model/interfaces/ICardEffect.java`
- `src/main/java/controller/interfaces/IGameManager.java`
- `CHANGES.md` - This file

### Removed Files
- `gson.jar` - Replaced by Maven dependency

### Moved Files
- All `.java` files moved to `src/main/java/`
- `cards.json` moved to `src/main/resources/`

## Compatibility

The changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Game mechanics unchanged
- All original features still work
- Can still run in bot or online mode
- Command line arguments remain the same

## Future Improvements

The new architecture supports:
- Additional game eras and expansions
- New card types with custom effects
- Different victory conditions
- AI players with different strategies
- Web-based UI
- Comprehensive unit tests
