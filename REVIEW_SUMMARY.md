- **LCOM** (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) - Cohesion quality assessment
- **Class Metrics** - All 44 classes ranked by size and complexity
- **Package Metrics** - Package-level statistics and dependencies
- **Afferent/Efferent Coupling** - Detailed dependency graphs
- **Trend Analysis** - Metrics to track for future reviews
- **Recommendations** - Specific refactoring targets with metrics

## Quick Summary

**Overall Grade: B+ (Good with room for improvement)**

### Top Strengths ‚úÖ
1. Clean MVC architecture implementation
2. Excellent SOLID principles adherence (especially DIP, LSP)
3. Low average coupling (2.1 dependencies per class)
4. Well-organized package structure (10 packages)
5. Good test suite (48 tests, all passing)

### Top Issues to Address üî¥
1. **Player class** - Too large (494 LOC, 33 methods)
   - Needs refactoring into 3-4 focused classes
   - Effort: 4-6 days
2. **Test coverage** - Only ~15% (need >70%)
   - Add unit tests for Player, GameController, ActionManager
   - Effort: 3-5 days
3. **Public fields** - Violate encapsulation
   - Make fields private with controlled access
   - Effort: 1-2 days

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Classes | 44 | - | ‚úÖ |
| Avg LOC/Class | 100.4 | <200 | ‚úÖ |
| Avg Coupling | 2.1 | <5 | ‚úÖ |
| Largest Class | 494 (Player) | <300 | ‚ùå |
| Test Coverage | ~15% | >70% | ‚ùå |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Do First) üî¥
1. Add unit tests for untested classes (Player, GameController, ActionManager)
2. Encapsulate public fields in Player and Card classes
3. Fix unsafe deserialization in OnlinePlayer

### Important (Do Soon) üü°
4. Refactor Player class - Extract ResourceManager and ScoreCalculator
5. Implement Command Pattern for actions (improves OCP)
6. Extract static card collections to GameState

### Nice to Have (Future) üü¢
7. Replace Vector with ArrayList (minor performance)
8. Add integration tests for game flow
9. Implement Observer pattern for events
