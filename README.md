## Architecture

The project follows **MVC architecture** and **SOLID principles**:

### MVC Pattern
- **Model**: Game entities (Card, Player, ResourceType, EventType) - Pure data and business logic
- **View**: I/O abstraction (IPlayerView and implementations) - Handles all user interaction
- **Controller**: Game flow managers (GameController, phase managers) - Coordinates game logic

### SOLID Principles Applied

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each class has one clear responsibility
   - View classes handle only I/O
   - GameController handles only game loop
   - Each manager handles one game phase

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - New view types can be added without modifying Player
   - New game phases can be added as new managers
   - Resource types can be extended in ResourceType class

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - All IPlayerView implementations are interchangeable
   - OnlinePlayer extends Player without breaking expectations
   - Bot players can substitute for regular players seamlessly

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - IPlayerView provides minimal interface for I/O
   - IGameManager provides minimal interface for phase managers
   - No unnecessary dependencies between components

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Player depends on IPlayerView interface, not concrete Scanner
   - GameController depends on manager abstractions
   - High-level modules don't depend on low-level details

### Key Interfaces

- **IPlayerView**: Abstraction for player I/O (console, network, bot)
- **IPlayer**: Abstraction for different player types (local, online, bot)
- **IGameManager**: Base for all game phase managers
- **ICardEffect**: Extensible card behavior system

### Design Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern**: Different player view implementations (Console, Network, Bot)
- **Manager Pattern**: Separate managers for each game phase
- **Factory Pattern**: Card creation and initialization
- **Dependency Injection**: Views injected into Player constructor

## Features

### Resource Validation
- All resource inputs are validated with retry on invalid entry
- Players must enter full resource names (Brick, Grain, Lumber, Wool, Ore, Gold)
- No more silent ignoring of invalid inputs

### Extensibility
- Interfaces allow for easy addition of new player types
- New game phases can be added as new managers
- Card effects can be extended through ICardEffect interface
- Prepared for future eras and expansions
- New view types (GUI, web) can be added without changing model

### Testability
- View layer can be mocked for testing
- Player logic testable without I/O
- Managers can be tested independently
- Clear separation of concerns enables unit testing

### Build System
- Maven handles all dependencies
- Single command to build and package
- Fat JAR includes all dependencies for easy distribution
