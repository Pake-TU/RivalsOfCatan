## SOLID Principles Analysis

### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - Grade: A-

**Strengths:**
- View classes (`IPlayerView` implementations) handle ONLY I/O
- Controllers (managers) each handle a single game phase
- `GameController` focuses solely on game flow orchestration
- Utility classes (`CostParser`, `PlacementValidator`) have clear, single purposes

**Areas for Improvement:**

#### 1. **Player class has too many responsibilities** (Priority: HIGH)
The `Player` class (787 lines) handles:
- Game state (resources, hand, principality)
- Resource management logic
- Grid manipulation
- Printing/formatting logic
- Scoring calculations
- I/O delegation

**Recommendation:** Split into multiple classes:
```java
// Suggested structure:
- PlayerState: Pure data holder (fields only)
- ResourceManager: Handle resource gaining/removing/validation
- PrincipalityManager: Handle grid operations (placeCard, getCard, expandAfterEdgeBuild)
- PlayerScoreCalculator: Scoring logic and advantage tokens
- PlayerPrinter: Formatting and display logic (or move to View)
```

**Benefit:** Each class becomes easier to test, maintain, and understand. Reduces cognitive load.

#### 2. **Card class mixes data and behavior** (Priority: MEDIUM)
The `Card` class contains:
- Card attributes (data)
- Static card piles (global state)
- Card loading logic
- Effect application logic (delegates to handlers, but still initiates)

**Recommendation:**
- Keep `Card` as a pure data class (DTO/Entity)
- Move static piles to `CardDeckManager` (already exists!)
- Move `loadBasicCards()` to `CardLoader`
- Move `applyEffect()` entirely to a `CardEffectCoordinator`

#### 3. **ActionManager is doing too much** (Priority: MEDIUM)
At 330 lines, `ActionManager` handles:
- Parsing commands
- Validating trades
- Finding cards in hand
- Paying/refunding costs
- LTS trade logic
- Display logic

**Recommendation:** Extract:
- `CommandParser`: Parse and validate commands
- `TradingManager`: Handle all trade logic (TRADE3, TRADE2, LTS)
- `CardPlayManager`: Handle PLAY command logic
- Keep `ActionManager` as thin coordinator

---

### ✅ Open/Closed Principle (OCP) - Grade: B+

**Strengths:**
- View implementations can be added without modifying `Player`
- New event handlers can be added implementing `IEventHandler`
- Resource types are defined in `ResourceType` (centralized)

**Areas for Improvement:**

#### 1. **Hard-coded game constants** (Priority: MEDIUM)
Throughout the code, there are magic numbers and strings:
```java
// GameController
private static final int EV_BRIGAND = EventType.BRIGAND;
private static final int EV_TRADE = EventType.TRADE;
// etc.

// Player
if (score >= 7) // win condition hard-coded
```

**Recommendation:**
- Create `GameConfiguration` class to hold:
  - Win condition (7 VP)
  - Hand size limits
  - Resource storage limits (3 per region)
  - Grid initial size (5x5)
  - Stack sizes (9 cards)

**Benefit:** Enables different game modes/variants without code changes.

#### 2. **Card effect logic is not truly extensible** (Priority: LOW)
The `Card.applyEffect()` method has hard-coded conditionals:
```java
if (nmEquals(nm, "Road") || nmEquals(nm, "Settlement") || nmEquals(nm, "City")) {
    return CenterCardEffectHandler.applyCenterCardEffect(...);
}
if ("Region".equalsIgnoreCase(type)) { ... }
if (placement != null && placement.equalsIgnoreCase("Settlement/city")) { ... }
```

**Recommendation:**
- Use Strategy pattern with a registry:
```java
Map<String, CardEffectStrategy> effectStrategies = new HashMap<>();
effectStrategies.put("Road", new RoadEffectStrategy());
effectStrategies.put("Region", new RegionEffectStrategy());
// etc.

// Usage:
CardEffectStrategy strategy = effectStrategies.get(card.type);
if (strategy != null) {
    return strategy.applyEffect(card, active, other, row, col);
}
```

**Benefit:** New card types can be added without modifying existing code.

---

### ✅ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - Grade: A

**Strengths:**
- All `IPlayerView` implementations are truly interchangeable
- `OnlinePlayer` extends `Player` without breaking contracts
- Controllers implementing `IGameManager` are substitutable

**Areas for Improvement:**

#### 1. **IPlayer interface is incomplete** (Priority: LOW)
`Player` implements `IPlayer`, but many methods used by controllers are not in the interface:
```java
// Not in IPlayer but used throughout:
- hasInPrincipality(String name)
- flags (public field access)
- tradeRate (public field access)
- victoryPoints, commercePoints, etc. (public field access)
- printPrincipality()
- printHand()
```

**Recommendation:**
- Either expand `IPlayer` to include these methods, OR
- Stop using `IPlayer` if it doesn't provide sufficient abstraction
- Make fields private and add proper getters/setters

**Benefit:** Enables true polymorphism and better encapsulation.

---

### ⚠️ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Grade: C+

**Strengths:**
- `IPlayerView` is minimal and focused
- `IEventHandler` is clean and simple

**Areas for Improvement:**

#### 1. **IPlayer is becoming a "fat interface"** (Priority: MEDIUM)
The `IPlayer` interface has 19+ methods and keeps growing. Classes implementing it may not need all methods.

**Recommendation:**
- Split into focused interfaces:
```java
interface IPlayerIO {
    void sendMessage(Object message);
    String receiveMessage();
}

interface IPlayerBoard {
    List<List<Card>> getPrincipality();
    Card getCard(int row, int col);
    void placeCard(int row, int col, Card card);
}

interface IPlayerHand {
    List<Card> getHand();
    void addToHand(Card card);
}

interface IPlayerResources {
    int getResourceCount(String type);
    void gainResource(String type);
    boolean removeResource(String type, int amount);
}

interface IPlayerScore {
    int getVictoryPoints();
    int getCommercePoints();
    // etc.
}

// Player implements all, but clients only depend on what they need:
class ProductionManager {
    public void applyProduction(IPlayerBoard board, IPlayerResources resources) {
        // Only depends on what it needs
    }
}
```

**Benefit:** Reduced coupling, clearer dependencies, easier testing.

#### 2. **IGameManager is too minimal** (Priority: LOW)
The interface only has `getPhaseName()` and `initialize()`, but all managers have similar execution patterns.

**Recommendation:**
- Consider adding common lifecycle methods if they exist
- Or keep it minimal if managers are truly different

---

### ⚠️ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - Grade: B

**Strengths:**
- `Player` depends on `IPlayerView` abstraction ✅
- Controllers depend on `Player` interface (partially) ✅
- No direct UI dependencies in model ✅

**Areas for Improvement:**

#### 1. **Concrete class dependencies instead of interfaces** (Priority: MEDIUM)

Throughout controllers, there are dependencies on concrete `Player` class:
```java
// GameController.java
public void runGameLoop(List<Player> players) // Should be List<IPlayer>

// ActionManager.java
public void actionPhase(Player active, Player other, ...) // Should be IPlayer

// ProductionManager.java
public void applyProduction(..., List<Player> players, ...) // Should be List<IPlayer>
```

**Recommendation:**
- Change all controller method signatures to use `IPlayer` instead of `Player`
- This enables:
  - Mocking for tests
  - Alternative player implementations
  - Reduced coupling

#### 2. **Static dependencies on Card piles** (Priority: MEDIUM)
Many classes access static fields directly:
```java
Card.roads
Card.settlements
Card.cities
Card.events
Card.regions
```

**Recommendation:**
- Inject `CardDeckManager` instead:
```java
class ActionManager {
    private final CardDeckManager deckManager;
    
    public ActionManager(CardDeckManager deckManager) {
        this.deckManager = deckManager;
    }
    
    // Use deckManager.getRoads() instead of Card.roads
}
```

**Benefit:** Testability (can mock decks), reduced coupling, better control.

#### 3. **No dependency injection framework** (Priority: LOW)
All dependencies are created with `new` keyword, making testing harder.

**Recommendation:**
- Consider using a lightweight DI framework (Guice, Spring DI, or manual factory)
- Or implement manual constructor injection consistently

---

## MVC Architecture Review

### Grade: A-

The architecture shows strong MVC separation after refactoring.

### Model Layer (model/) - Grade: A

**Strengths:**
- Pure business logic
- No I/O dependencies
- Clear domain entities (Card, Player, ResourceType, EventType)
- Effect handlers separated into `model.effects` package

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Player class too large** (see SRP section)
2. **Card has static state** - move to dedicated manager
3. **Public fields** - encapsulation is weak:
   ```java
   public int victoryPoints = 0;
   public int progressPoints = 0;
   public Set<String> flags = new HashSet<>();
   public Map<String, Integer> resources = new HashMap<>();
   ```
   
   **Recommendation:** Make fields private, add getters/setters

### View Layer (view/) - Grade: A

**Strengths:**
- Clean abstraction with `IPlayerView`
- Multiple implementations (Console, Bot, Network)
- No business logic in views
- Clear separation of concerns

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Player formatting logic in Model** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   
   Methods like `printPrincipality()` and `printHand()` in `Player` class should be in View layer:
   
   **Recommendation:**
   ```java
   // Move to view/PlayerFormatter.java or view/ConsolePlayerView.java
   class PlayerFormatter {
       public static String formatPrincipality(Player player, Player opponent) { ... }
       public static String formatHand(Player player) { ... }
   }
   ```

2. **No GUI view** (Priority: LOW, future enhancement)
   - Architecture supports it, but not implemented
   - Consider JavaFX or Swing view implementation

### Controller Layer (controller/) - Grade: B+

**Strengths:**
- Clear game phase separation
- `GameController` orchestrates flow well
- Managers are mostly focused

**Areas for Improvement:**

#### 1. **Controllers create their own dependencies** (Priority: MEDIUM)
```java
public class GameController {
    private final ProductionManager productionManager = new ProductionManager();
    private final ReplenishManager replenishManager = new ReplenishManager();
    // etc.
}
```

**Recommendation:**
```java
public class GameController {
    private final ProductionManager productionManager;
    private final ReplenishManager replenishManager;
    // etc.
    
    public GameController(ProductionManager productionManager, 
                          ReplenishManager replenishManager, ...) {
        this.productionManager = productionManager;
        // etc.
    }
}
```

**Benefit:** Testability, flexibility, loose coupling.

#### 2. **Callback functions passed around** (Priority: LOW)
```java
actionManager.actionPhase(active, other, s -> broadcast(s, players));
productionManager.applyProduction(prodFace, players, p -> opponentOf(p, players));
```

While functional programming is fine, consider if these indicate missing abstractions.

**Recommendation:** 
- Consider `GameContext` object holding players and broadcast method
- Or keep as-is if callbacks work well

#### 3. **No validation of game state transitions** (Priority: LOW)
The game loop in `GameController` doesn't validate state transitions.

**Recommendation:**
- Consider State pattern for game phases
- Or FSM (Finite State Machine) for turn structure

## Booch Metrics Analysis

### Coupling (Connections between classes) - Grade: B

**Metrics:**
- **Afferent Coupling (Ca):** How many classes depend on this class
- **Efferent Coupling (Ce):** How many classes this class depends on

**High Coupling Classes:**

1. **Player class** - HIGH efferent coupling
   - Depends on: IPlayerView, Card, ResourceType, IPlayer
   - Used by: Almost all controllers and managers
   - **Issue:** Changes to Player ripple widely
   
2. **Card class** - HIGH afferent coupling
   - Used by: All managers, Player, effect handlers
   - **Issue:** Central bottleneck
   
3. **ActionManager** - HIGH efferent coupling
   - Depends on: Player, Card, CostParser, ResourceType, CardDeckManager
   - **Issue:** Too many dependencies

**Recommendations:**
- Reduce Player's responsibilities (see SRP section)
- Make Card a simple DTO
- Inject dependencies instead of static access
- Use interfaces to reduce concrete coupling

### Cohesion (How related are elements within a class) - Grade: B+

**High Cohesion (Good):**
- View classes: All methods relate to I/O
- Utility classes (CostParser, PlacementValidator): Focused utilities
- Event handlers: Each handles one event type

**Low Cohesion (Needs Improvement):**

1. **Player class** - Methods fall into 5+ distinct categories:
   - Resource management (gainResource, removeResource, setResourceCount)
   - Grid operations (getCard, placeCard, expandAfterEdgeBuild)
   - Printing (printPrincipality, printHand)
   - Scoring (currentScoreAgainst, hasTradeTokenAgainst)
   - I/O delegation (sendMessage, receiveMessage)
   - Hand management (addToHand, removeFromHandByName)
   
   **Issue:** Low cohesion indicates SRP violation

2. **Card class** - Mixes data, static state, and behavior
   
**Recommendations:**
- Split Player into focused classes (ResourceManager, BoardManager, etc.)
- Make Card a pure data class
- Move behavior to dedicated service classes

### Complexity - Grade: B

**Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis:**

**High Complexity Methods:**

1. **Player.printPrincipality()** (~60 lines)
   - Nested loops, string building, conditional logic
   - **Recommendation:** Extract helper methods or move to View

2. **ActionManager.actionPhase()** (~230 lines, large method)
   - Command parsing with multiple branches
   - **Recommendation:** Split into smaller methods or use Command pattern

3. **Card.applyEffect()** (~40 lines with conditionals)
   - Multiple if-else chains
   - **Recommendation:** Use Strategy pattern

**Low Complexity (Good):**
- Most event handlers
- Utility classes
- View implementations

### Sufficiency (Are abstractions complete?) - Grade: B-

**Incomplete Abstractions:**

1. **IPlayer interface missing methods** (see LSP section)
   - `hasInPrincipality()`, `printPrincipality()`, `printHand()`, etc. not in interface
   
2. **No abstraction for game rules**
   - Win condition hard-coded (>= 7 VP)
   - Resource limits hard-coded (3 per region)
   - No configuration interface

3. **No abstraction for card decks**
   - Static fields in Card class instead of proper CardDeckManager usage
   
**Recommendations:**
- Complete the IPlayer interface or remove it
- Create GameRules/GameConfiguration interface
- Use CardDeckManager properly

### Primitiveness (Are abstractions at the right level?) - Grade: B+

**Good Level:**
- `ResourceType` provides nice abstraction over resource names
- `EventType` centralizes event constants
- Effect handlers abstract card behavior

**Too Primitive:**
- Using `String` for everything (card names, resource types, flags)
  - **Recommendation:** Consider enums or value objects:
    ```java
    enum Resource { BRICK, GRAIN, LUMBER, WOOL, ORE, GOLD }
    class CardName { private final String value; ... }
    ```

**Too Complex:**
- None identified

---

## Specific Areas for Improvement

### 1. Testing & Testability (Priority: HIGH)

**Current State:**
- 48 tests, all passing ✅
- Tests cover: Card stats, placement validation, cost parsing, events, advantage tokens

**Issues:**
- No integration tests
- No tests for GameController
- No tests for most managers (ProductionManager, ActionManager, etc.)
- Hard to test due to tight coupling and static dependencies

**Recommendations:**

1. **Add controller tests:**
   ```java
   @Test
   void testGameControllerTurnFlow() {
       IPlayer player1 = mock(IPlayer.class);
       IPlayer player2 = mock(IPlayer.class);
       GameController controller = new GameController();
       // Test turn progression
   }
   ```

2. **Make Player testable:**
   - Add constructor accepting all dependencies
   - Extract interfaces for major components
   - Remove static Card dependencies

3. **Add integration tests:**
   - Full game playthrough with bots
   - Network communication tests
   - Edge cases (empty decks, full grids, etc.)

4. **Test coverage goals:**
   - Aim for 80%+ coverage of business logic
   - 100% coverage of critical paths (scoring, win conditions)

### 2. Error Handling (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Current State:**
- Extensive use of `try-catch (Exception ignored)`
- Silent failures in many places
- No custom exceptions

**Issues:**
```java
// Player.java
try {
    return Integer.parseInt(s.trim());
} catch (Exception e) {
    return 0; // Silent failure
}

// ActionManager.java
try {
    int idx = Integer.parseInt(spec);
    // ...
} catch (NumberFormatException ignored) { } // Silent failure
```

**Recommendations:**

1. **Create custom exception hierarchy:**
   ```java
   class GameException extends Exception { }
   class InvalidPlacementException extends GameException { }
   class InsufficientResourcesException extends GameException { }
   class InvalidCardException extends GameException { }
   ```

2. **Handle errors properly:**
   - Log errors (add logging framework)
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Don't ignore exceptions unless truly safe

3. **Validate inputs:**
   - Add precondition checks
   - Use Optional<T> for nullable returns
   - Fail fast with clear messages

### 3. Code Duplication (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Identified Duplications:**

1. **Resource validation logic** appears in multiple places:
   ```java
   // Player.validateAndPromptResource()
   // Player.promptAndRemoveResource()
   // Similar validation in multiple locations
   ```

2. **Card finding logic** duplicated:
   ```java
   // Card.popCardByName()
   // ActionManager.findCardInHand()
   ```

3. **Cost parsing and payment:**
   ```java
   // ActionManager.payCost()
   // ActionManager.refundCost()
   // Similar logic could be in other managers
   ```

**Recommendations:**
- Extract common logic to utility classes
- Use inheritance or composition for shared behavior
- Create ResourceValidator, CardFinder utilities

### 4. Documentation (Priority: LOW)

**Current State:**
- Good class-level JavaDoc
- Many methods documented
- Architecture documented in README

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Missing JavaDoc on public methods:**
   - Many methods in Player lack JavaDoc
   - Some utility methods undocumented

2. **Complex algorithms need explanation:**
   - `expandAfterEdgeBuild()` logic is complex
   - `setResourceCount()` distribution algorithm

3. **Add package-info.java files:**
   ```java
   /**
    * Controller layer - handles game flow and phase management.
    * Follows MVC pattern...
    */
   package controller;
   ```

### 5. Configuration Management (Priority: LOW)

**Current State:**
- Magic numbers throughout code
- Hard-coded game constants
- No external configuration

**Recommendations:**

1. **Create GameConfiguration class:**
   ```java
   class GameConfiguration {
       private final int winConditionVP = 7;
       private final int maxResourcesPerRegion = 3;
       private final int initialHandSize = 3;
       private final int gridInitialSize = 5;
       // etc.
   }
   ```

2. **Support external configuration:**
   - Properties file for game settings
   - JSON for card definitions (already done ✅)
   - Allow custom game variants

---

## Security Considerations

### Current State:
- CodeQL scan identified 1 issue: Unsafe deserialization
- Documented in `SECURITY.md`
- Mitigation in place (post-deserialization validation)

### Recommendations:

1. **Replace Java Serialization** (Priority: HIGH)
   ```java
   // Current (unsafe):
   ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
   Object obj = in.readObject();
   
   // Recommended:
   // Use JSON with Gson (already a dependency):
   Gson gson = new Gson();
   String json = in.readLine();
   Message msg = gson.fromJson(json, Message.class);
   ```

2. **Add input validation** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Validate all player inputs (coordinates, resource names, commands)
   - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection

3. **Add authentication** (Priority: LOW, for production)
   - Player authentication for online games
   - Session management
   - Rate limiting
